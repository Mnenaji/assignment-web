	Ed , Edd and Eddy was an early childhood show that I enjoyed watching.The main characters there were 
	Ed (Mono Brow, Big Lump), Edd (Double D, Sock head) and	Eddy (The man with the plans, No neck chump). 
	Other characters include Jimmy, Rolf, Sarah, Nazz, Kevin, Johny and the Kanker Sisters. What makes this
	cartoon series enjoyable is how Eddy comes up with scams and can even sell a radio just to get a jaw
	breaker.
	</p>
	<P>
	The jaw breaker that the begin to suck is so large that their whole cheeks becomes twice the size of their 
	head. I once did eat a jaw breaker and I do agree that a child's taste buds should be engulfed by the sweetness
	of that candy. The three main actors are usually beaten by the rest of the neighbour hood kids but what I have 
	never understood is why ed is beaten by them. He is stronger than all children in that society but dumb. I do 
	agree that Rolf, the son of a shephard is strong and loves to show off his muscles but Ed is stronger than him 
	by far.
	</p>

	I look at another group of three scouts. They are called the Sub-urban Rangers. That group consists of three 
	members, Rolf the son of a shephard, Jimmy and Johnny. There is also an addition of the plank of wood, Plank.
	Plank is an imaginary friend of Johnny and surprises me a lot. Johnny is not smart but that plank of wood seems 
	to be even more smarter and clever by far than Eddy, who, by the way, is the kingpin of all scams in the whole 
	neighbourhood.
