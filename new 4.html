	Courage The Cowardly Dog was another best childhood cartoon that I did like to watch. The main 
	characters there were Courage the dog, Meuriel and	Eustess. The other characters were evil villains 
	that were scary and some good characters while some characters there were bad characters changed to 
	good people. Most of the time the show ended with Courage and Meuriel while some scenes ended with 
	Eustess being safe while other scenes had Eustess suffering or	being in great torture.
	</p>
	<p>
	This show is like a horror movie in kids shows. When I was young, it was not humorous but very scary.
	At my current age, rewatching it makes me laugh at how much they extremely exegerate fear using a dog.
	The dog is so afraid and screams until his insides come out and you can see the heart pumping as it 
	was vomited out together with his insides. What even makes the show extremely funny is when courage 
	tries to explain why he is screaming and afraid, he is able to shape shift to even an exploding bomb 
	or the creature he just saw.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have seen some instances courage being able to solve disputes and many situations. Courage even 
	saved Eustess some times but Eustess is ungrateful. He calls courage stupid dog. This is the main reason 
	why Courage always and forever saves Meuriel. In some episodes, very few to be exact, the scene is very 
	sad, sad enough to make a full grown man shed a tear. An episode involved a space squid going extinct.
	The father of the eggs risked his life to save his wife and the seven offsprings that they sired together.
	The female or wife later died after the seven offsprings hatched to later form the new generations of 
	space squids.
