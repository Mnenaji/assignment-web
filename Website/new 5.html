	Tom and Jerry cartoon was an all time classic. Many young children and adults of all ages still enjoy 
	that cartoon even today. The cartoon had 2 major characters, Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse. All the 
	other characters were just put to make the show enjoyable. You	could even see the owner who kept Tom 
	as a house cat to catch the mouse, Tom had friends and Jerry had friends and relatives. I do remember 
	that Tom also had nieces.
	</p>

	The show becomes very interesting when Tom can speak and even sing. There are so many different versions 
	of Tom and Jerry. There is the original show Tom and Jerry, a new show that was later introduced Tom 
	and Jerry Kids, Tom and Jerry Tales and I saw new versions of Tom and Jerry. Nowadays they release many 
	Tom and Jerry movies that I really wish I could watch but time fails to be on my side.

	What makes this show interesting is how they over exegerate hits. Tom is shot with bullets and drinks 
	water only for the water to pass through bullet holes in his body. Tom is hit with iron box to the point 
	he becomes a table. An electricity post falls and hits tom on the head multiple times until he is driven 
	to the ground like a nail driven into wood by a hammer multiple times. I have never witnessed jerry mouse 
	ever being eaten by Tom and most of the time Jerry wins. Tom has concoured very few times.
