	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<div>
	<p>
	I am a cartoon enthusiast and I have chosen to make a website describing my best cartoon shows.
	Many of my cartoons were from cartoon network but there are also other cartoonsfrom other stations
	that I like. The main stations for cartoons I like are cartoon network, boomerang and Nickelodeon.
	Majority of the cartoons that I have enlisted are 2D and I still like some 3D cartoons but I will stick
	to 2D for now.

	<p>
	Ed , Edd and Eddy was an early childhood show that I
	enjoyed watching.The main characters there were Ed (Mono Brow, Big Lump), Edd (Double D, Sock head) and 
	Eddy (The man with the plans, No neck chump). Other characters include Jimmy, Rolf, Sarah, Nazz, Kevin,
	Johny and the Kanker Sisters.

	</div>
	<div>
	<p>
	Fairy Odd Parents was another childhood cartoon that
	I did like watching when I was a young lad. The main character there was Timmy Tunner and other semi 
	main characters include Cosmo and Wanda, Timmy's dad and mom, timmy's babby sitter Vicky and my favourite 
	of them all was the nut-head teacher, Mr Kracker. That guy cracked me up with laughter and humour.

	<a href="new 4.html" onclick= "clickc();"><h2> Courage the Cowardly Dog Show </h2></a>
	<div>
	<a href="new 4.html"><img src="image\images6.jpeg" width="680" height="370" onmouseover= "jinao();" onclick= "clickc();" alt="Courage the Cowardly Dog Show" /></a>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>
	Courage The Cowardly Dog was another best 
	childhood cartoon that I did like to watch. The main characters there were Courage the dog, Meuriel and 
	Eustess. the other characters were evil villains that were scary and some good characters while some 
	characters there were bad characters changed to good people. Most of the time the show ended with Courage 
	and Meuriel while some scenes ended with Eustess being safe while other scenes had Eustess suffering or 
	being in great torture.

	<a href="new 5.html" onclick= "clickt();"><h2> Tom And Jerry </h2></a>
	<div>
	<a href="new 5.html"><img src="image\images3.jpeg" width="680" height="370" onmouseover= "jinaz();" onclick= "clickt();" alt="Tom And Jerry" /></a>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>
	Tom and Jerry cartoon was an all time classic. Many young 
	children and adults of all ages still enjoy that cartoon even today. The cartoon had 2 major characters,
	Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse. All the other characters were just put to make the show enjoyable. You 
	could even see the owner who kept Tom as a house cat to catch the mouse, Tom had friends and Jerry had 
	friends and relatives.
