	Fairy Odd Parents was another childhood cartoon that I did like watching when I was a young lad. The main 
	character there was Timmy Tunner and other semi main characters include Cosmo and Wanda, Timmy's dad and 
	mom, timmy's babby sitter Vicky and my favourite of them all was the nut-head teacher, Mr Kracker. That guy 
	cracked me up with laughter and humour.

	This show involved Timmy Tunner requesting for wishes using the magic words "I wish". Without those words,
	no wishing would be possible. the wishes are granted by his fairy odd parents, Cosmo and Wanda. Cosmo is not
	a clever fairy and is the husband of Wanda. Wanda on the other hand is clever. In the later episodes of the 
	show, they managed to sire a son and they named him Puff. The only words that the child can communicate are
	"puff puff".

	Timmy's dad is also not clever but the mother is. The mother works in a prestigious company while the father
	is lucky to get a job. The job that I once witnessed him do was work in a pencil making company. Most of the 
	time, he does house chores. We then have a very humorous teacher of Timmy who is very clever as he has a lab 
	and knows that Timmy has fairies. His name is Mr. Kracker. He seems to have gone Krackers after discovering 
	about ferries. His main aim is to capture those fairies and nothing more.
